# CLS-Motor

A closed-loop control system designed to stack with stepper motors and provide real-time feedback using a magnetic encoder. It detects missed steps and corrects them using an onboard STM32 microcontroller while also supplying your communication line through the CAN bus ports to your main microcontroller.

This Motor doesnt just reperesnt a nearly year long worth of work regarding aquring new information about circuits and PCB's while applying that very information to my current CLS Motor design, but is also a representation of a journey of commitment and aspiration of knowledge I have been longing for since the start of learning programming and being introduced to technology.
