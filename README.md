# CLS-Motor
A closed-loop control system designed to stack with stepper motors and provide real-time feedback using a magnetic encoder. It detects missed steps and corrects them using an onboard STM32 microcontroller while also supplying your communication line through the CAN bus ports to your main microcontroller.
