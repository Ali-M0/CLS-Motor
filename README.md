A closed-loop control system designed to stack with stepper motors and provide real-time feedback using a magnetic encoder. It detects missed steps and corrects them using an onboard STM32 microcontroller while also supplying your communication line through the CAN bus ports to your main microcontroller.



In the field of robotics, precision and reliability in motor control are essential. During the development of my robotic arm project, I identified the limitations of traditional open-loop stepper systems, particularly their inability to self-correct under load. To address this, I designed and implemented a closed-loop stepper motor driver, combining custom hardware and software to enable real-time position correction.



This project involved designing a 6-layer PCB in KiCad, optimized for signal integrity and thermal performance. At its core is a STM32F103CBT6 microcontroller, chosen for its surprisingly high processing speed, rich I/O capabilities, and the fact that itâ€™s only main purpose is to power the encoder and can transceiver along with any other I/O necessary within the board. I integrated a MT6816 magnetic rotary encoder on the rear shaft of a NEMA 17 stepper motor to provide high-resolution feedback, enabling the system to compare target and actual positions, and through the use of a custom correction software using C++ and CLion the motor is able to adjust it's actuation based on the current step resolution. You also may be wondering how my system is powered. That's done through a cascade power system that cascades through a daisy chain design and supply's power to all the CLS motors, being ultimately powered by a +5V power supply.
